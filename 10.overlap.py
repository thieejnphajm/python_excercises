# This weekâ€™s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise (see Exercise 5),
# except require the solution in a different way.

# Take two lists, say for example these two:

# 	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
# 	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
# and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are
# common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two
# lists of different sizes. Write this using at least one list comprehension.
# (Hint: Remember list comprehensions from Exercise 7).

# Extra:

# Randomly generate two lists to test this

import random

a = random.sample(range(10), 10)
b = random.sample(range(20), 10)
print "a: ", a
print "b: ", b

commons = [i for i in a if i in b]

print "commons: ", commons
